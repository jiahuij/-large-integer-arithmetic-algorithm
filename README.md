# -large-integer-arithmetic-algorithm

a program in VS C++ 2017 to implement the large integer arithmetic algorithm shown in class. Let's assume the threshold to switch from the large integer arithmetic algorithm to the standard multiplication algorithm is 2. When your program is running, it should first prompt the user for twononnegativeintegersentered on one line butseparated by at least one space. It then computes the result using the large integer arithmetic algorithmshown in class. The result is then displayed on the screen. Your program then verifies the result by multiplying the two integers again using the standard multiplication method. The result should also be displayed on the screen.The following shows a scenarioof running a sample program, where user's inputs are represented in boldface.Enter two nonnegativeintegers: 87111653The result determined using the large integer arithmeticalgorithmis10149763The result determined using the standard algorithmis10149763
